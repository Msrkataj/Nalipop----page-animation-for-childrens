**Nalipop - page animation for childrens**

Project "Nallipop" is a website offering animation services for children. The entire project was designed by me, both visually and technically.
I used **Adobe XD* for designing the user interface, while **Adobe Illustrator**, **Photoshop**, and **midjourney** were utilized for creating the graphics.

The website was built using technologies such as **React**, **Next.js**, **SASS** and **Firebase**. 
It is fully responsive, meaning it perfectly adapts to various screen resolutions and devices. Additionally, the dynamic submission of forms on the admin page enables easy content and offer management.

During the creation of the website, I focused on quality and attention to detail, striving to provide the best experience for users. 
The "Nallipop" project is continuously being developed and improved to meet the growing expectations of customers and keep up with technological advancements in the industry.
